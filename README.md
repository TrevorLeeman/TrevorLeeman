## Hi there, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m Trevor Leeman, Software Engineer at MDLinx and owner of [OSRS Exchange](https://www.osrs.exchange).

As an avid TypeScript user with a knack for full stack web development, I love creating websites that users find useful and pleasant to use. Beyond user facing features, I am a sucker for creating slick CI / CD pipelines that let developers forget that deployment can be hard.

I'd love to collaborate! You can reach me at trevormleeman@gmail.com, look forward to hearing from you :)
